Creating an app that is able to use android beam  to share files.

In particura our app meant to allow an user to share his contacts (Name,Adress,Phone Number, Instagram....) to another user even idf the later one does not posses the app.

The only hardware requirement is that both users device has the Android Beam (Huawei Beam) function enabled.


The App deals with 2 main functualities:
Creating user profile and saving It ( using VCard)
Sending VCF file to the other user using NFC (for Paring) and Bluetooth
